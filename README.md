## What Is This?

A structured 6-phase workflow that guides you and AI to build production-ready foundations:

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1. Intent | 30 min | Requirements clarified |
| 2. Architecture | 60-90 min | Design documented |
| 3. Foundation | 2-3 hrs | First feature working |
| 4. Refinement | 1-2 hrs | Code cleaned |
| 5. Testing | 60 min | >80% coverage |
| 6. Docs | 30 min | Complete documentation |

## Quick Start

After installation, say to your AI:

```
Let's build a [your idea] from scratch
```

**Examples:**
- "Let's build a REST API for user management from scratch"
- "Let's build a CLI tool for file organization from scratch"
- "Let's build a data pipeline for stock prices from scratch"

The AI automatically enters the workflow and guides you through all 6 phases.
